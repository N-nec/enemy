# Shooting Enemies for Minetest ... Works well with RangedWeapons Mod

They spawn at Night time, Dog Spawns anytime, Some shoot flame, some glow.. some are hard to see... They are designed to kill you.

I maybe update it soon with some serious Killing Machines.

I lowerd the spawn rate - Damage is high. these can be adusted just ask me or anyone how to change them.
